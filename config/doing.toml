text = "Working with images has always been one of my core interests, and it first took shape during my high school years when I built an object detection and human recognition system for the *Echoic* team in the Virtual Rescue League at Iran Open 2018. This system helped our team achieve second place, competing at a university level, and sparked my fascination with computer vision. Since then, I have explored tasks like face reconstruction, image classification, and other visual recognition problems."

text = "Combining software and hardware has always intrigued me. In my first academic paper, I co-developed *PenSLR*, a glove-based system equipped with sensors to detect Persian Sign Language glosses. This end-to-end deep learning approach demonstrated the potential of wearable technology to enhance accessibility and communication. My experience working with microcontrollers like Arduino and Raspberry Pi further deepened my interest in creating intuitive and impactful interfaces."
