title = "PenSLR: Persian end-to-end Sign Language Recognition Using Ensembling"
subtitle = "Sign Language Recognition (SLR) is a fast-growing field that aims to bridge communication gaps between the hearing-impaired and others. Solutions for Persian Sign Language (PSL) are limited to word-level interpretations, underscoring the need for a system that can interpret complex gesture combinations in an end-to-end manner. Moreover, previous work on other languages often focuses on manipulating neural network architectures or hardware configurations. However, leveraging the combined outputs of multiple models remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce PenSLR, a glove-based system with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and five flexible sensors powered by a deep learning framework for predicting variable-length sequences. Using the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function, PenSLR eliminates the need for input signal segmentation. To enhance capabilities, we propose an ensembling technique based on multiple sequence alignment and introduce a new PSL dataset with 16 signs and over 3000 samples. We use this dataset to evaluate our system's performance on longer, previously unseen sentences. PenSLR achieves word accuracy of 94.58% and 96.70% in subject-independent and subject-dependent setups, respectively. These results highlight the impact of our ensembling algorithm, which enhances word-level performance by 0.51% and 1.32%, and improves sentence-level accuracy by 1.46% and 4.00% in each respective setup."

subtitle = """The Echoic team participated in the RoboCup 2018 Virtual Robot League, focusing on multi-robot exploration and visual victim detection. Using the SLAM Gmapping package and multi-agent flood exploration strategies, our team developed an approach to construct a global shared map for better area coverage. Additionally, we leveraged convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for victim detection, balancing computational efficiency and detection accuracy. A graphical interface was implemented to enhance robot control and simplify parameter tuning. These innovations aimed to advance rescue robotics by reducing time and improving detection reliability in simulated disaster environments. Over three consecutive years of participation in RoboCup, team echoic secured <a href="https://www.robocup.org/leagues/27">second</a> and <a href="https://www.robocup.org/leagues/27">third</a> places in the first and second years. Although unable to attend RoboCup in the final year due to personal issues, we participated in the Robocup(IRAN OPEN) robotics competition and won second place."""

title = "Learning to Rank Influential Nodes in Complex Networks via Convolutional Neural Networks"
subtitle = "This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to rank influential nodes in complex networks. By extracting multi-scale topological features using degree and H-index centrality, the method generates feature embeddings for each node and trains a CNN model to predict influence scores. Using the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model for label generation, this approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both real-world and synthetic networks, evaluated using metrics such as Kendall's Ï„ and MAP. The proposed framework is efficient, scalable, and applicable across diverse network structures."
