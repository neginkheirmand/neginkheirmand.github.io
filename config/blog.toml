title = "PenSLR: Persian end-to-end Sign Language Recognition Using Ensembling"
subtitle = "Sign Language Recognition (SLR) is a fast-growing field that aims to bridge communication gaps between the hearing-impaired and others. Solutions for Persian Sign Language (PSL) are limited to word-level interpretations, underscoring the need for a system that can interpret complex gesture combinations in an end-to-end manner. Moreover, previous work on other languages often focuses on manipulating neural network architectures or hardware configurations. However, leveraging the combined outputs of multiple models remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce PenSLR, a glove-based system with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and five flexible sensors powered by a deep learning framework for predicting variable-length sequences. Using the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function, PenSLR eliminates the need for input signal segmentation. To enhance capabilities, we propose an ensembling technique based on multiple sequence alignment and introduce a new PSL dataset with 16 signs and over 3000 samples. We use this dataset to evaluate our system's performance on longer, previously unseen sentences. PenSLR achieves word accuracy of 94.58% and 96.70% in subject-independent and subject-dependent setups, respectively. These results highlight the impact of our ensembling algorithm, which enhances word-level performance by 0.51% and 1.32%, and improves sentence-level accuracy by 1.46% and 4.00% in each respective setup."
