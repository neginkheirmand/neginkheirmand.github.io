presentation = """
I’m a Computer Engineering graduate from Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) in Iran. My interest in AI began during high school, where I was fascinated by its potential to transform the world. This passion led me to focus on AI throughout my studies at AUT, allowing me to gain a deep understanding of this growing field.
                       
What makes my approach unique is that I don’t limit myself to one specific area of AI. I believe in exploring different concepts like Data Mining, Computer Vision, NLP and Trustworthy AI. This broader perspective helps me come up with new ideas and tackle a variety of challenges.

With a solid foundation in these areas, I’m always eager to continue learning and apply my skills to solve new problems in the AI landscape.
